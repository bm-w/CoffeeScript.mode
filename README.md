This is fork of Sean Durham's Coda/SubEthaEdit syntax coloring mode for the
CoffeeScript language, revisited for use with Coda 2.

Special thanks to brajeshwar's Sass.Mode and jashkenas' TextMate bundle--Sean
apparently used them for reference while developing this mode.

Installation
============
 
- Download and unpack either the ZIP or TAR version of the CoffeeScript mode.
- Rename the unzipped directory to 'CoffeeScript.mode'.
- Coda:
  Manually copy the CoffeeScript.mode directory into ~/Library/Application\ Support/Coda 2/Modes/.
